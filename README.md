# active-reader
Enter a big block of text; get a multiple choice quiz from it. 

ActiveReader is a little project that turns a block of text into a series of multiple choice, context-based quizzes. The idea behind it is that in trying to solve the riddle of the missing word in the sentence, you engage more with the content and get more out of the reading experience. I have no evidence that this works, but I’ve found it helpful for my own use. Also there’s plenty of literature on the benefits of [quizzing for recall](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/test-enhanced-learning-using-retrieval-practice-to-help-students-learn/). Also, the fonts are… uncommon, which has [been shown to improve learning](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/font.html), so there’s that. 

Thanks to [GeekLad](http://geeklad.com) for the stop word removal and [this fun Javascript quiz tutorial](http://www.flashbynight.com/tutes/mcqquiz/).
